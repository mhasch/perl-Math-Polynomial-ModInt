Math-Polynomial-ModInt
======================

Math::Polynomial::ModInt is a subclass of Math::Polynomial for modular
integer coefficient spaces.  It adds domain-specific methods and
stringification options to the base class.  Notably, it implements a
bijection from unsigned integers to polynomials for a given modulus.
