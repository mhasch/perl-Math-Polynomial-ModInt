Development Guidelines
----------------------

This library, dealing with a mathematical concept, should first and
foremost be scientifically sound.  Correctness is rated over all other
quality aspects.  The second most important goal is a documentation and
over-all presentation that makes it useful for experts and informative
for anybody interested in the field.  Thirdly, it should be easy to
integrate correctly and efficiently with other software.

Topics of interest
------------------

Possible improvements may support interoperability with related, or
more general, or application software.  An XS implementation could
increase performance with large spaces.  The data model, on the other
hand, does not seem performance-critical, as applications can always
store and restore objects via their index numbers.

Other improvements could help the documentation to be clearer, or more
complete, or better formatted.  We might create POD, TEX, HTML, and PDF
from a common source.  And, of course, there is always room for cool
examples and references to application modules.

Author's Note
-------------

Thanks again for your interest.
I am looking forward to your report or e-mail.
